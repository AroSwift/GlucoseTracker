#Project Name: Glucose Tracker
#Project Owner: Kawsar Project
#Description:  
Patients submit their food intake, blood glucose level and exercise information from their phone applications and doctors can view those information graphically from a phone application or web app


# Aaron's Discussion Notes with Dr. Kawsar:
Two views:
- Doctor
- Patient

DIABETIC, DOCTORS interested in carbohydrates, water, vitamins, protein, how much carbohydrates int that food, minerals, monitoring diabetic, HOW MUCH CARBOHYDRATES IN FOOD. When entering food, page called food / meal, enter data for breakfast, enter plus sign, add a food like apple, bread, banana. Food API from government that has ingredients of food. Apple would show ingredients and calculate carbohydrates. Doctor sees carbohydrates. Need food / meal menu for patient. Use free version of API. Patient should also have the data stored on them to help them see what works for them and what does not.

Doctor will see this graphically. Patient doesnâ€™t get that information, just for doctor. Doctor can see a list of all patients and can select 1 and get all the information for that patient.

Glucose:
Before breakfast, after lunch, after dinner enter glucose level. Glucose level higher after meal. Need to say before or after meal. Dropdown menu: before / after & breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Date is current date and time. But, should have an option to change date. Default is current date. Submit. Doctor will be able to see a longitudinal data. IF HAVE TIME: see all before and after food records.

In settings for doctor:
Doctor will be able to setup a threshold. If glucose is too low or too high, send an alarm. Have the option to setup and get a notification somehow.

In settings for patient:
- Have a reminder to enter blood glucose level every day. Two alarms for two meals a day maybe.

Excersie information: how many steps, how active you are. If cannot do this, must do it manually: have four actives such as biking, walking, running, elliptical.

We should have both the web application and the mobile application. Doctor would prefer web application. Pretty similar to what we discussed about web application.

If everything works and have time: would like to compare two patients.
